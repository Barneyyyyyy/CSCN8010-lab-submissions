# Lab 6 - Logistic Regression

1. Using SciKit-Learn, train a logistic regression model on the Iris dataset. Use all four features. Define only 2 labels: `virginica` and `non-virginica`. See the logistic regression notebook presented in class for a demonstration on how to set up these labels (3 points).
2. Provide insights about the model prediction. This is an open-ended part. But you can look into questions such as _in which data instances is the model wrong? are there any shared properties for these cases?_ and _how is the model doing, across a set of _performance metrics_ such as _accuracy_ and _confusion metric_.

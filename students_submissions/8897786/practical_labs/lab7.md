# Lab 7 - Performance Metrics for Classification Problems

* Make a copy of the `performance_metrics_for_classification` notebook in our class notebooks repository, and paste it to your folder in the `lab-submissions` repository.
* Answer the questions in that notebook. Answers should be in a new cell below each question. Questions are marked by "**To the student**" text.
* Convert to HTML and create a PR with both your notebook and the HTML. Add the link to the HTML in the PR description.

Grade will be proportional to the number of correct answers out of all answers.
